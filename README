Myos - Make Your Own Soup
Demo app using Vert.x and MongoDB

This project uses vertx-maven-plugin, please follow these instructions to set it up : https://github.com/rhart/vertx-maven-plugin/blob/master/README.md

As myos-0.1.1 uses mongo-persistor busmod, you'll need a local Vert.x installed and have to specify 'vertxHomeDirectory' option in pom.xml. 
I hope vertx-maven-plugin will do that in the future.
